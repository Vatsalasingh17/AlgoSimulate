**🖥️ Operating System Algorithms Visual Simulator**
An interactive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to demonstrate core Operating System algorithms through real-time visual simulations.
This project helps users understand how Page Replacement and Disk Scheduling algorithms work internally by visualizing their behavior step by step.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Understanding Operating System algorithms can be challenging when learned only theoretically.
This project bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing dynamic visual simulations for commonly used OS algorithms.

**Users can:**

Input custom data (pages, frames, disk requests)

Observe algorithm execution visually

Compare performance using metrics like page faults and seek time
