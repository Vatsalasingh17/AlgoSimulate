**🖥️ Operating System Algorithms Visual Simulator**
An interactive web-based application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to demonstrate core Operating System algorithms through real-time visual simulations.
This project helps users understand how Page Replacement and Disk Scheduling algorithms work internally by visualizing their behavior step by step.

**🚀 Project Overview**

Understanding Operating System algorithms can be challenging when learned only theoretically.
This project bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing dynamic visual simulations for commonly used OS algorithms.

**Users can:**

Input custom data (pages, frames, disk requests)

Observe algorithm execution visually

Compare performance using metrics like page faults and seek time

**🧠 Algorithms Implemented
📄 Page Replacement Algorithms
**
These algorithms manage memory by deciding which page to remove when a new page needs to be loaded.

**FIFO (First In First Out)**

Replaces the oldest loaded page

**LRU (Least Recently Used)**

Replaces the page that hasn’t been used for the longest time

**Optimal Page Replacement**

Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future

**🔹 Features**

Step-by-step page replacement visualization

Real-time page fault count

Clear distinction between hits and faults
